This script scrapes data from the following urls:
- https://ods.org.hn/predespacho-diario
- https://cnd.ods.org.hn/predespacho-semanal

<p><b>Instructions:</b>
Create two folders in the script's running directory ('backup' and 'temp') then run the script.</p>

<p><b>How it works</b>: At runtime, the script checks for previously downloaded documents then moves them into the <i>backup</i> folder. New documents are then downloaded into the <i>temp</i> folder.</p>
