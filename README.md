This script scrapes the following urls for data:
- https://ods.org.hn/predespacho-diario
- https://cnd.ods.org.hn/predespacho-semanal

The documents are then deownloaded into a "temp" folder created. If the script is run again, the downloaded documents are backed up to a folder named "backup" before downloading new ones.
